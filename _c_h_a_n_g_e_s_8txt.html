Framework * We no longer create a separate framework build for .NET 3.5. The 2.0 and 3.5 builds were essentially the same, so the former should now be used under both runtimes. * A new Constraint, DictionaryContainsKeyConstraint, may be used to test that a specified key is present in a dictionary. * LevelOfParallelizationAttribute has been renamed to LevelOfParallelismAttribute. * The Silverlight runner now displays output in color and includes any text output created by the tests. * The class and method names of each test are included in the output xml where applicable. * String arguments used in test case names are now truncated to 40 rather than 20 characters. Engine * The engine API has now been finalized. It permits specifying a minimum version of the engine that a runner is able to use. The best installed version of the engine will be loaded. Third-party runners may override the selection process by including a <a class="el" href="_n_unit_83_812_80_2_l_i_c_e_n_s_e_8txt.html#a1eb74c643bf1808d269e6d78c5f4ac79">copy</a> of the engine in their installation directory and specifying that it must be used. * The V2 framework driver now uses the event listener and test listener passed to it by the runner. This corrects several outstanding issues caused by events not being received and allows selecting V2 tests to be run from the command-line, in the same way that V3 tests are selected. Console * The console now defaults to not using shadowcopy. There is a new option --shadowcopy to turn it on if needed. Issues Resolved * 224 Silverlight Support * 318 TestActionAttribute: Retrieving the TestFixture * 428 Add ExpectedExceptionAttribute to C# samples * 440 Automatic selection of Test Engine to use * 450 Create master install that includes the framework, engine and console installs * 477 Assert does not work with ArraySegment * 482 nunit-console has multiple errors related to -framework option * 483 Adds constraint for asserting that a dictionary contains a particular key * 484 Missing file in NUnit.Console nuget package * 485 Can't run v2 tests with nunit-console 3.0 * 487 NUnitLite can't load assemblies by their file name * 488 Async setup and teardown still don't work * 497 Framework installer shold register the portable framework * 504 Option --workers:0 is ignored * 508 Travis builds with failure in engine tests show as successful * 509 Under linux, not all mono profiles are listed as available * 512 Drop the .NET 3.5 build * 517 V2 FrameworkDriver does not make use of passed in TestEventListener * 523 Provide an option to disable shadowcopy in NUnit v3 * 528 V2 FrameworkDriver does not make use of passed in TestFilter * 530 Color display for Silverlight runner * 531 Display text output from tests in Silverlight runner * 534 Add classname and methodname to test result xml * 541 Console help doesn't indicate defaults NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 5 - January 30, 2015 General * A Windows installer is now included in the release packages. Framework * TestCaseAttribute now allows arguments with default values to be omitted. Additionaly, it accepts a Platform property to specify the platforms on which the test case should be run. * TestFixture and TestCase attributes now enforce the requirement that a reason needs to be provided when ignoring a test. * SetUp, TearDown, OneTimeSetUp and OneTimeTearDown methods may now be async. * String arguments over 20 characters in length are truncated when used as part of a test name. Engine * The engine is now extensible using Mono.Addins. In this release, extension points are provided for FrameworkDrivers, ProjectLoaders and OutputWriters. The following addins are bundled as a part of NUnit: * A FrameworkDriver that allows running NUnit V2 tests under NUnit 3.0. * ProjectLoaders for NUnit and Visual Studio projects. * An OutputWriter that creates XML output in NUnit V2 format. * DomainUsage now defaults to Multiple if not specified by the runner Console * New options supported: * --testlist provides a list of tests to run in a file * --stoponerror indicates that the run should terminate when any test fails. Issues Resolved * 20 TestCaseAttribute needs Platform property. * 60 NUnit should support async setup, teardown, fixture setup and fixture teardown. * 257 TestCaseAttribute should not require parameters with default values to be specified. * 266 Pluggable framework drivers. * 368 Create addin model. * 369 Project loader addins * 370 OutputWriter addins * 403 Move ConsoleOptions.cs and Options.cs to Common and share... * 419 Create Windows Installer for NUnit. * 427 [TestFixture(Ignore=true)] should not be allowed. * 437 Errors in tests under Linux due to hard-coded paths. * 441 NUnit-Console should support --testlist option * 442 Add --stoponerror option back to nunit-console. * 456 Fix memory leak in RuntimeFramework. * 459 Remove the Mixed Platforms build configuration. * 468 Change default domain usage to multiple. * 469 Truncate string arguments in test names in order to limit the length. NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 4 - December 30, 2014 Framework * ApartmentAttribute has been added, replacing STAAttribute and MTAAttribute. * Unnecessary overloads of Assert.That and Assume.That have been removed. * Multiple SetUpFixtures may be specified in a single namespace. * Improvements to the Pairwise strategy test case generation algorithm. * The new NUnitLite runner --testlist option, allows a list of tests to be kept in a file. Engine * A driver is now included, which allows running NUnit 2.x tests under NUnit 3.0. * The engine can now load and run tests specified in a number of project formats: * NUnit (.nunit) * Visual Studio C# projects (.csproj) * Visual Studio F# projects (.vjsproj) * Visual Studio Visual Basic projects (.vbproj) * Visual Studio solutions (.sln) * Legacy C++ and Visual JScript projects (.csproj and .vjsproj) are also supported * Support for the current C++ format (.csxproj) is not yet available * Creation of output files like TestResult.xml in various formats is now a service of the engine, available to any runner. Console * The command-line may now include any number of assemblies and/or supported projects. Issues Resolved * 37 Multiple SetUpFixtures should be permitted on same namespace * 210 TestContext.WriteLine in an AppDomain causes an error * 227 Add support for VS projects and solutions * 231 Update C# samples to use NUnit 3.0 * 233 Update F# samples to use NUnit 3.0 * 234 Update C++ samples to use NUnit 3.0 * 265 Reorganize console reports for nunit-console and nunitlite * 299 No full path to assembly in XML file under Compact Framework * 301 Command-line length * 363 Make Xml result output an engine service * 377 CombiningStrategyAttributes don't work correctly on generic methods * 388 Improvements to NUnitLite runner output * 390 Specify exactly what happens when a test times out * 396 ApartmentAttribute * 397 CF nunitlite runner assembly has the wrong name * 407 Assert.Pass() with ]]&gt; in message crashes console runner * 414 Simplify Assert overloads * 416 NUnit 2.x Framework <a class="el" href="_c_h_a_n_g_e_s_8txt.html#a7798afaab454537551942af4d5bd15ab">Driver</a> * 417 Complete work on NUnit projects * 420 Create Settings file in proper location NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 3 - November 29, 2014 Breaking Changes * NUnitLite tests must reference both the nunit.framework and nunitlite assemblies. Framework * The NUnit and NUnitLite frameworks have now been merged. There is no longer any distinction between them in terms of features, although some features are not available on all platforms. * The release includes two new framework builds: compact framework 3.5 and portable. The portable library is compatible with .NET 4.5, Silverlight 5.0, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8.1, Windows Phone Silverlight 8, Mono for Android and MonoTouch. * A number of previously unsupported features are available for the Compact Framework: - Generic methods as tests - RegexConstraint - TimeoutAttribute - FileAssert, DirectoryAssert and file-related constraints Engine * The logic of runtime selection has now changed so that each assembly runs by default in a separate process using the runtime for which it was built. * On 64-bit systems, each test process is automatically created as 32-bit or 64-bit, depending on the platform specified for the test assembly. Console * The console runner now runs tests in a separate process per assembly by default. They may still be run in process or in a single separate process by use of command-line options. * The console runner now starts in the highest version of the .NET runtime available, making it simpler to debug tests by specifying that they should run in-process on the command-line. * The -x86 command-line option is provided to force execution in a 32-bit process on a 64-bit system. * A writeability check is performed for each output result file before trying to run the tests. * The -teamcity option is now supported. Issues Resolved * 12 Compact framework should support generic methods * 145 NUnit-console fails if test result message contains invalid xml characters * 155 Create utility classes for platform-specific code * 223 Common code for NUnitLite console runner and NUnit-Console * 225 Compact Framework Support * 238 Improvements to running 32 bit tests on a 64 bit system * 261 Add portable nunitlite build * 284 NUnitLite Unification * 293 CF does not have a CurrentDirectory * 306 Assure NUnit can write resultfile * 308 Early disposal of runners * 309 NUnit-Console should support incremental output under TeamCity * 325 Add RegexConstraint to compact framework build * 326 Add TimeoutAttribute to compact framework build * 327 Allow generic test methods in the compact framework * 328 Use .NET Stopwatch class for compact framework builds * 331 Alpha 2 CF does not build * 333 Add parallel execution to desktop builds of NUnitLite * 334 Include File-related constraints and syntax in NUnitLite builds * 335 Re-introduce 'Classic' NUnit syntax in NUnitLite * 336 Document use of separate obj directories per build in our projects * 337 Update Standard Defines page for .NET 3.0 * 341 Move the NUnitLite runners to separate assemblies * 367 Refactor XML Escaping Tests * 372 CF Build TestAssemblyRunnerTests * 373 Minor CF Test Fixes * 378 Correct documentation for PairwiseAttribute * 386 Console Output Improvements NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 2 - November 2, 2014 Breaking Changes * The console runner no longer displays test results in the debugger. * The NUnitLite compact framework 2.0 build has been removed. * All addin support has been removed from the framework. Documentation of NUnit 3.0 extensibility features will be published in time for the beta release. In the interim, please ask for support on the nunit-discuss list. General * A separate solution has been created for Linux * We now have continuous integration builds under both Travis and Appveyor * The compact framework 3.5 build is now working and will be supported in future releases. New Features * The console runner now automatically detects 32- versus 64-bit test assemblies. * The NUnitLite report output has been standardized to match that of nunit-console. * The NUnitLite command-line has been standardized to match that of nunit-console where they share the same options. * Both nunit-console and NUnitLite now display output in color. * ActionAttributes now allow specification of multiple targets on the attribute as designed. This didn't work in the first alpha. * OneTimeSetUp and OneTimeTearDown failures are now shown on the test report. Individual test failures after OneTimeSetUp failure are no longer shown. * The console runner refuses to run tests build with older versions of NUnit. A plugin will be available to run older tests in the future.

Additional classes will be made internal for the final 3.0 release. Engine * Added a core engine which is a non-extensible, minimal engine for use by devices and similar situations where reduced functionality is compensated for by reduced size and simplicity of usage. See https: Issues Resolved * 22 Add OSArchitecture Attribute to Environment node in result xml * 24 Assert on Dictionary Content * 48 Explicit seems to conflict with Ignore * 168 Create NUnit 3.0 documentation * 196 Compare DateTimeOffsets including the offset in the comparison * 217 New icon for the 3.0 release * 316 NUnitLite TextUI Runner * 320 No Tests found: Using parametrized Fixture and TestCaseSource * 360 Better exception message when using non-BCL class in property * 454 Rare registry configurations may cause NUnit to fail * 478 RepeatAttribute * 481 Testing multiple assemblies in nunitlite * 538 Potential bug using TestContext in constructors * 546 Enable Parallel in NUnitLite/CF (or more) builds * 551 TextRunner not passing the NumWorkers option to the ITestAssemblyRunner * 556 Executed tests should always return a non-zero duration * 559 Fix text of NuGet packages * 560 Fix PackageVersion property on wix install projects * 562 Program.cs in NUnitLite NuGet package is incorrect * 564 NUnitLite Nuget package is Beta 1a, Framework is Beta 1 * 565 NUnitLite Nuget package adds Program.cs to a VB Project * 568 Isolate packaging from building * 570 ThrowsConstraint failure message should include stack trace of actual exception * 576 Throws.ArgumentNullException would be nice * 577 Documentation on some members of Throws falsely claims that they return `TargetInvocationException` constraints * 579 No documentation for recommended usage of TestCaseSourceAttribute * 580 TeamCity Service Message Uses Incorrect Test Name with NUnit2Driver * 582 Test Ids Are Not Unique * 583 TeamCity service messages to support parallel test execution * 584 Non-runnable assembly has incorrect ResultState * 609 Add support for integration with TeamCity * 611 Remove unused --teamcity option from CF build of NUnitLite * 612 MaxTime doesn't work when used for TestCase * 621 Core Engine * 622 nunit-console fails when use --output * 628 Modify IService interface and simplify ServiceContext * 631 Separate packaging for the compact framework * 646 ConfigurationManager.AppSettings Params Return Null under Beta 1 * 648 Passing 2 or more test assemblies targeting &gt; .NET 2.0 to nunit-console fails NUnit 3.0.0 Beta 1 - March 25, 2015 General * There is now a master windows installer for the framework, engine and console runner. Framework * We no longer create a separate framework build for .NET 3.5. The 2.0 and 3.5 builds were essentially the same, so the former should now be used under both runtimes. * A new Constraint, DictionaryContainsKeyConstraint, may be used to test that a specified key is present in a dictionary. * LevelOfParallelizationAttribute has been renamed to LevelOfParallelismAttribute. * The Silverlight runner now displays output in color and includes any text output created by the tests. * The class and method names of each test are included in the output xml where applicable. * String arguments used in test case names are now truncated to 40 rather than 20 characters. Engine * The engine API has now been finalized. It permits specifying a minimum version of the engine that a runner is able to use. The best installed version of the engine will be loaded. Third-party runners may override the selection process by including a <a class="el" href="_n_unit_83_812_80_2_l_i_c_e_n_s_e_8txt.html#a1eb74c643bf1808d269e6d78c5f4ac79">copy</a> of the engine in their installation directory and specifying that it must be used. * The V2 framework driver now uses the event listener and test listener passed to it by the runner. This corrects several outstanding issues caused by events not being received and allows selecting V2 tests to be run from the command-line, in the same way that V3 tests are selected. Console * The console now defaults to not using shadowcopy. There is a new option --shadowcopy to turn it on if needed. Issues Resolved * 224 Silverlight Support * 318 TestActionAttribute: Retrieving the TestFixture * 428 Add ExpectedExceptionAttribute to C# samples * 440 Automatic selection of Test Engine to use * 450 Create master install that includes the framework, engine and console installs * 477 Assert does not work with ArraySegment * 482 nunit-console has multiple errors related to -framework option * 483 Adds constraint for asserting that a dictionary contains a particular key * 484 Missing file in NUnit.Console nuget package * 485 Can't run v2 tests with nunit-console 3.0 * 487 NUnitLite can't load assemblies by their file name * 488 Async setup and teardown still don't work * 497 Framework installer shold register the portable framework * 504 Option --workers:0 is ignored * 508 Travis builds with failure in engine tests show as successful * 509 Under linux, not all mono profiles are listed as available * 512 Drop the .NET 3.5 build * 517 V2 FrameworkDriver does not make use of passed in TestEventListener * 523 Provide an option to disable shadowcopy in NUnit v3 * 528 V2 FrameworkDriver does not make use of passed in TestFilter * 530 Color display for Silverlight runner * 531 Display text output from tests in Silverlight runner * 534 Add classname and methodname to test result xml * 541 Console help doesn't indicate defaults NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 5 - January 30, 2015 General * A Windows installer is now included in the release packages. Framework * TestCaseAttribute now allows arguments with default values to be omitted. Additionaly, it accepts a Platform property to specify the platforms on which the test case should be run. * TestFixture and TestCase attributes now enforce the requirement that a reason needs to be provided when ignoring a test. * SetUp, TearDown, OneTimeSetUp and OneTimeTearDown methods may now be async. * String arguments over 20 characters in length are truncated when used as part of a test name. Engine * The engine is now extensible using Mono.Addins. In this release, extension points are provided for FrameworkDrivers, ProjectLoaders and OutputWriters. The following addins are bundled as a part of NUnit: * A FrameworkDriver that allows running NUnit V2 tests under NUnit 3.0. * ProjectLoaders for NUnit and Visual Studio projects. * An OutputWriter that creates XML output in NUnit V2 format. * DomainUsage now defaults to Multiple if not specified by the runner Console * New options supported: * --testlist provides a list of tests to run in a file * --stoponerror indicates that the run should terminate when any test fails. Issues Resolved * 20 TestCaseAttribute needs Platform property. * 60 NUnit should support async setup, teardown, fixture setup and fixture teardown. * 257 TestCaseAttribute should not require parameters with default values to be specified. * 266 Pluggable framework drivers. * 368 Create addin model. * 369 Project loader addins * 370 OutputWriter addins * 403 Move ConsoleOptions.cs and Options.cs to Common and share... * 419 Create Windows Installer for NUnit. * 427 [TestFixture(Ignore=true)] should not be allowed. * 437 Errors in tests under Linux due to hard-coded paths. * 441 NUnit-Console should support --testlist option * 442 Add --stoponerror option back to nunit-console. * 456 Fix memory leak in RuntimeFramework. * 459 Remove the Mixed Platforms build configuration. * 468 Change default domain usage to multiple. * 469 Truncate string arguments in test names in order to limit the length. NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 4 - December 30, 2014 Framework * ApartmentAttribute has been added, replacing STAAttribute and MTAAttribute. * Unnecessary overloads of Assert.That and Assume.That have been removed. * Multiple SetUpFixtures may be specified in a single namespace. * Improvements to the Pairwise strategy test case generation algorithm. * The new NUnitLite runner --testlist option, allows a list of tests to be kept in a file. Engine * A driver is now included, which allows running NUnit 2.x tests under NUnit 3.0. * The engine can now load and run tests specified in a number of project formats: * NUnit (.nunit) * Visual Studio C# projects (.csproj) * Visual Studio F# projects (.vjsproj) * Visual Studio Visual Basic projects (.vbproj) * Visual Studio solutions (.sln) * Legacy C++ and Visual JScript projects (.csproj and .vjsproj) are also supported * Support for the current C++ format (.csxproj) is not yet available * Creation of output files like TestResult.xml in various formats is now a service of the engine, available to any runner. Console * The command-line may now include any number of assemblies and/or supported projects. Issues Resolved * 37 Multiple SetUpFixtures should be permitted on same namespace * 210 TestContext.WriteLine in an AppDomain causes an error * 227 Add support for VS projects and solutions * 231 Update C# samples to use NUnit 3.0 * 233 Update F# samples to use NUnit 3.0 * 234 Update C++ samples to use NUnit 3.0 * 265 Reorganize console reports for nunit-console and nunitlite * 299 No full path to assembly in XML file under Compact Framework * 301 Command-line length * 363 Make Xml result output an engine service * 377 CombiningStrategyAttributes don't work correctly on generic methods * 388 Improvements to NUnitLite runner output * 390 Specify exactly what happens when a test times out * 396 ApartmentAttribute * 397 CF nunitlite runner assembly has the wrong name * 407 Assert.Pass() with ]]&gt; in message crashes console runner * 414 Simplify Assert overloads * 416 NUnit 2.x Framework <a class="el" href="_c_h_a_n_g_e_s_8txt.html#a7798afaab454537551942af4d5bd15ab">Driver</a> * 417 Complete work on NUnit projects * 420 Create Settings file in proper location NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 3 - November 29, 2014 Breaking Changes * NUnitLite tests must reference both the nunit.framework and nunitlite assemblies. Framework * The NUnit and NUnitLite frameworks have now been merged. There is no longer any distinction between them in terms of features, although some features are not available on all platforms. * The release includes two new framework builds: compact framework 3.5 and portable. The portable library is compatible with .NET 4.5, Silverlight 5.0, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8.1, Windows Phone Silverlight 8, Mono for Android and MonoTouch. * A number of previously unsupported features are available for the Compact Framework: - Generic methods as tests - RegexConstraint - TimeoutAttribute - FileAssert, DirectoryAssert and file-related constraints Engine * The logic of runtime selection has now changed so that each assembly runs by default in a separate process using the runtime for which it was built. * On 64-bit systems, each test process is automatically created as 32-bit or 64-bit, depending on the platform specified for the test assembly. Console * The console runner now runs tests in a separate process per assembly by default. They may still be run in process or in a single separate process by use of command-line options. * The console runner now starts in the highest version of the .NET runtime available, making it simpler to debug tests by specifying that they should run in-process on the command-line. * The -x86 command-line option is provided to force execution in a 32-bit process on a 64-bit system. * A writeability check is performed for each output result file before trying to run the tests. * The -teamcity option is now supported. Issues Resolved * 12 Compact framework should support generic methods * 145 NUnit-console fails if test result message contains invalid xml characters * 155 Create utility classes for platform-specific code * 223 Common code for NUnitLite console runner and NUnit-Console * 225 Compact Framework Support * 238 Improvements to running 32 bit tests on a 64 bit system * 261 Add portable nunitlite build * 284 NUnitLite Unification * 293 CF does not have a CurrentDirectory * 306 Assure NUnit can write resultfile * 308 Early disposal of runners * 309 NUnit-Console should support incremental output under TeamCity * 325 Add RegexConstraint to compact framework build * 326 Add TimeoutAttribute to compact framework build * 327 Allow generic test methods in the compact framework * 328 Use .NET Stopwatch class for compact framework builds * 331 Alpha 2 CF does not build * 333 Add parallel execution to desktop builds of NUnitLite * 334 Include File-related constraints and syntax in NUnitLite builds * 335 Re-introduce 'Classic' NUnit syntax in NUnitLite * 336 Document use of separate obj directories per build in our projects * 337 Update Standard Defines page for .NET 3.0 * 341 Move the NUnitLite runners to separate assemblies * 367 Refactor XML Escaping Tests * 372 CF Build TestAssemblyRunnerTests * 373 Minor CF Test Fixes * 378 Correct documentation for PairwiseAttribute * 386 Console Output Improvements NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 2 - November 2, 2014 Breaking Changes * The console runner no longer displays test results in the debugger. * The NUnitLite compact framework 2.0 build has been removed. * All addin support has been removed from the framework. Documentation of NUnit 3.0 extensibility features will be published in time for the beta release. In the interim, please ask for support on the nunit-discuss list. General * A separate solution has been created for Linux * We now have continuous integration builds under both Travis and Appveyor * The compact framework 3.5 build is now working and will be supported in future releases. New Features * The console runner now automatically detects 32- versus 64-bit test assemblies. * The NUnitLite report output has been standardized to match that of nunit-console. * The NUnitLite command-line has been standardized to match that of nunit-console where they share the same options. * Both nunit-console and NUnitLite now display output in color. * ActionAttributes now allow specification of multiple targets on the attribute as designed. This didn't work in the first alpha. * OneTimeSetUp and OneTimeTearDown failures are now shown on the test report. Individual test failures after OneTimeSetUp failure are no longer shown. * The console runner refuses to run tests build with older versions of NUnit. A plugin will be available to run older tests in the future. Issues Resolved * 222 Color console for NUnitLite * 229 Timing failures in tests * 241 Remove reference to Microslft BCL packages * 243 Create solution for Linux * 245 Multiple targets on action attributes not implemented * 246 C++ tests do not compile in VS2013 * 247 Eliminate trace display when running tests in debug * 255 Add new result states for more precision in where failures occur * 256 ContainsConstraint break when used with AndConstraint * 264 Stacktrace displays too many entries * 269 Add manifest to nunit-console and nunit-agent * 270 OneTimeSetUp failure results in too much output * 271 Invalid tests should be treated as errors * 274 Command line options should be case insensitive * 276 NUnit-console should not reference nunit.framework * 278 New result states (ChildFailure and SetupFailure) break NUnit2XmlOutputWriter * 282 Get tests for NUnit2XmlOutputWriter working * 288 Set up Appveyor CI build * 290 Stack trace still displays too many items * 315 NUnit 3.0 alpha: Cannot run in console on my assembly * 319 CI builds are not treating test failures as failures of the build * 322 Remove Stopwatch tests where they test the real .NET Stopwatch NUnit 3.0.0 Alpha 1 - <a class="el" href="_c_h_a_n_g_e_s_8txt.html#a6e249e64733f54d4a9afeec802920ab1">September</a> 22, 2014 Breaking Changes * Legacy suites are no longer supported * Assert.NullOrEmpty is no longer supported (Use Is.Null.Or.Empty) General * MsBuild is now used for the build rather than NAnt * The framework test harness has been removed now that nunit-console is at a point where it can run the tests. New Features * Action Attributes have been added with the same features as in NUnit 2.6.3. * TestContext now has a method that allows writing to the XML output. * TestContext.CurrentContext.Result now provides the error message and stack trace during teardown. * Does prefix operator supplies several added constraints.
